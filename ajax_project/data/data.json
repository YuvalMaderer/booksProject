        "description": "The annual colloquium on information retrieval research provides an opportunity for both new and established researchers to present papers describing work in progress or ?nal results. This colloquium was established by the BCS IRSG(B- tish Computer Society Information Retrieval Specialist Group), and named the Annual Colloquium on Information Retrieval Research. Recently, the location of the colloquium has alternated between the United Kingdom and continental Europe. To re?ect the growing European orientation of the event, the colloquium was renamed \u201cEuropean Annual Colloquium on Information Retrieval Research\u201d from 2001. Since the inception of the colloquium in 1979 the event has been hosted in the city of Glasgow on four separate occasions. However, this was the ?rst time that the organization of the colloquium had been jointly undertaken by three separate computer and information science departments; an indication of the collaborative nature and diversity of IR research within the universities of the West of Scotland. The organizers of ECIR 2002 saw a sharp increase in the number of go- quality submissions in answer to the call for papers over previous years and as such 52 submitted papers were each allocated 3 members of the program committee for double blind review of the manuscripts. A total of 23 papers were eventually selected for oral presentation at the colloquium in Glasgow which gave an acceptance rate of less than 45% and ensured a very high standard of the papers presented.",

Because guidance on how a study\u2019s limited findings should not be used is rare, practitioners must understand and evaluate for themselves the veracity and implications of the inherently limited primary literature findings they use as sources of drug information to make evidence-based decisions together with their patients. The editors organized the book into three supporting sections to meet their pedagogical goals and address practitioners\u2019 needs in translating research into practice. Thanks to the editors, authors, and content of this book, you can now be more prepared than ever before for translating research into practice.\" L.

        "description": "Consider the problem of a robot (algorithm, learning mechanism) moving along the real line attempting to locate a particular point ? . To assist the me- anism, we assume that it can communicate with an Environment (\u201cOracle\u201d) which guides it with information regarding the direction in which it should go. If the Environment is deterministic the problem is the \u201cDeterministic Point - cation Problem\u201d which has been studied rather thoroughly [1]. In its pioneering version [1] the problem was presented in the setting that the Environment could charge the robot a cost which was proportional to the distance it was from the point sought for. The question of having multiple communicating robots locate a point on the line has also been studied [1, 2]. In the stochastic version of this problem, we consider the scenario when the learning mechanism attempts to locate a point in an interval with stochastic (i. e. , possibly erroneous) instead of deterministic responses from the environment. Thus when it should really be moving to the \u201cright\u201d it may be advised to move to the \u201cleft\u201d and vice versa. Apart from the problem being of importance in its own right, the stoch- tic pointlocationproblemalsohas potentialapplications insolvingoptimization problems.

        "description": "The literature on cytokine genetics is vast, so vast that it is now practically beyond the time or logistical constraints of most scientists to successfully keep pace with it. A compilation of the latest research, Cytokine Gene Polymorphisms in Multifactorial Conditions brings together, reviews, and structures up-to-date information on polymorphisms in cytokine genes. It discusses haplotype structures and linkage disequilibrium patterns in cytokine gene loci; functional biological effects of polymorphisms; and genetic associations with disease. The book documents polymorphisms in the most important cytokine genes, or gene clusters, and their biological and genetic effects in a multitude of distinct multifactorial conditions. Unique to this book are the \"disease-centered\" chapters examining the role of cytokine gene polymorphisms in a multitude of multifactorial conditions. The conditions include autoimmune or chronic inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular disease, infectious diseases, and longevity. \"This section is a real tour de force\" (Grant Gallagher and Michael F. Seldin, March 2006). Broadening the understanding of the effect of genetic variations on human immune responses, the organization, scope, and content of this book make it a valuable and easily accessible resource. The book integrates genetic, immunological, and clinical information and will serve as a reference for novice and expert geneticists, immunologists, cell biologists and clinicians. It is a must for everyone involved in, or planning, cytokine genetics or immunogenetics studies.",

For decades the agency has dealt with questions about what animal-testing data to use to make predictions about human health hazards, how to perform dose-response extrapolations, how to identify and protect susceptible subpopulations, and how to address uncertainties. As alternatives to traditional toxicity testing have emerged, the agency has been faced with additional questions about how to incorporate data from such tests into its chemical assessments and whether such tests can replace some traditional testing methods. Endocrine active chemicals (EACs) have raised concerns that traditional toxicity-testing protocols might be inadequate to identify all potential hazards to human health because they have the ability to modulate normal hormone function, and small alterations in hormone concentrations, particularly during sensitive life stages, can have lasting and significant effects. To address concerns about potential human health effects from EACs at low doses, this report develops a strategy to evaluate the evidence for such low-dose effects.",

All issues important for understanding and using published research for these purposes are covered. Key principles are illustrated with research studies published in refereed journals across a wide spectrum of education. Exercises distributed throughout the text encourage readers to engage interactively with what they are reading at the point when the information is fresh in their minds. This text is designed for higher level undergraduate and graduate programs. Course instructors will find that it provides a solid framework in which to promote student interaction and discussion on important issues in research methodology.",

Although the book provides a brief but thorough review of the technologies which are available for these purposes, most of the book concerns practical \u2018future-proof\u2019 techniques which are independent of changes in the tools available. For example, the book covers: how to retrieve salient information quickly; how to remove or compensate for bias; and tuition of novice Internet users. Importantly, the book enables readers to develop strategies which will continue to be useful despite the rapidly-evolving state of the Internet and Internet technologies - it is not about technological tricks Enables readers to be aware of and compensate for bias and errors which are ubiquitous on the Internet Provides contemporary information on the deficiencies in web skills of novice users as well as practical techniques for teaching such users",

This invaluable guide provides step-by-step instructions for investigating Internet crimes, including locating, interpreting, understanding, collecting, and documenting online electronic evidence to benefit investigations. Cybercrime is the fastest growing area of crime as more criminals seek to exploit the speed, convenience and anonymity that the Internet provides to commit a diverse range of criminal activities. Today's online crime includes attacks against computer data and systems, identity theft, distribution of child pornography, penetration of online financial services, using social networks to commit crimes, and the deployment of viruses, botnets, and email scams such as phishing. Symantec's 2012 Norton Cybercrime Report stated that the world spent an estimated $110 billion to combat cybercrime, an average of nearly $200 per victim. Law enforcement agencies and corporate security officers around the world with the responsibility for enforcing, investigating and prosecuting cybercrime are overwhelmed, not only by the sheer number of crimes being committed but by a lack of adequate training material. This book provides that fundamental knowledge, including how to properly collect and document online evidence, trace IP addresses, and work undercover. Provides step-by-step instructions on how to investigate crimes online Covers how new software tools can assist in online investigations Discusses how to track down, interpret, and understand online electronic evidence to benefit investigations Details guidelines for collecting and documenting online evidence that can be presented in court",

We all know how to look up something online by typing words into a search engine. We do this so often that we have made the most famous search engine a verb: we Google it\u2014\u201cJapan population\u201d or \u201cNobel Peace Prize\u201d or \u201cpoison ivy\u201d or whatever we want to know. But knowing how to Google something doesn't make us search experts; there's much more we can do to access the massive collective knowledge available online. In The Joy of Search, Daniel Russell shows us how to be great online researchers. We don't have to be computer geeks or a scholar searching out obscure facts; we just need to know some basic methods. Russell demonstrates these methods with step-by-step searches for answers to a series of intriguing questions\u2014from \u201cwhat is the wrong side of a towel?\u201d to \u201cwhat is the most likely way you will die?\u201d Along the way, readers will discover essential tools for effective online searches\u2014and learn some fascinating facts and interesting stories. Russell explains how to frame search queries so they will yield information and describes the best ways to use such resources as Google Earth, Google Scholar, Wikipedia, and Wikimedia. He shows when to put search terms in double quotes, how to use the operator (*), why metadata is important, and how to triangulate information from multiple sources. By the end of this engaging journey of discovering, readers will have the definitive answer to why the best online searches involve more than typing a few words into Google.",

        "description": "With its theme, \"Our Information, Always and Forever,\" Part I of this book covers the basics of personal information management (PIM) including six essential activities of PIM and six (different) ways in which information can be personal to us. Part I then goes on to explore key issues that arise in the \"great migration\" of our information onto the Web and into a myriad of mobile devices. Part 2 provides a more focused look at technologies for managing information that promise to profoundly alter our practices of PIM and, through these practices, the way we lead our lives. Part 2 is in five chapters: - Chapter 5. Technologies of Input and Output. Technologies in support of gesture, touch, voice, and even eye movements combine to support a more natural user interface (NUI). Technologies of output include glasses and \"watch\" watches. Output will also increasingly be animated with options to \"zoom\". - Chapter 6. Technologies to Save Our Information. We can opt for \"life logs\" to record our experiences with increasing fidelity. What will we use these logs for? And what isn\u2019t recorded that should be? - Chapter 7. Technologies to Search Our Information. The potential for personalized search is enormous and mostly yet to be realized. Persistent searches, situated in our information landscape, will allow us to maintain a diversity of projects and areas of interest without a need to continually switch from one to another to handle incoming information. - Chapter 8. Technologies to Structure Our Information. Structure is key if we are to keep, find, and make effective use of our information. But how best to structure? And how best to share structured information between the applications we use, with other people, and also with ourselves over time? What lessons can we draw from the failures and successes in web-based efforts to share structure? - Chapter 9. PIM Transformed and Transforming: Stories from the Past, Present and Future. Part 2 concludes with a comparison between Licklider\u2019s world of information in 1957 and our own world of information today. And then we consider what the world of information is likely to look like in 2057. Licklider estimated that he spent 85% of his \"thinking time\" in activities that were clerical and mechanical and might (someday) be delegated to the computer. What percentage of our own time is spent with the clerical and mechanical? What about in 2057?",

I never worked in the industry, and I don't have any experience working for the big publishers. In fact, the only thing I consider myself an expert in is how to sell on eBay, Amazon, and Fiverr... So why should you listen to me? Like most indie authors, I came into publishing through the back door. I had a story to tell, and one day I just sat down and let it all come out. What I wrote wasn't pretty, or polished...but, it helped a lot of people sell more stuff on eBay. What I couldn't say with fancy prose, I made up for with enthusiasm. Because of that, my books sold.

Previous research shows that language contributes to gender inequality in various ways: Gender-related information is transmitted through formal and semantic features of language, such as the grammatical category of gender, through gender-related connotations of role names (e.g., manager, secretary), and through customs of denoting social groups with derogatory vs. neutral names. Both as a formal system and as a means of communication, language passively reflects culture-specific social conditions. In active use it can also be used to express and, potentially, perpetuate those conditions. The questions addressed in the contributions to this Frontiers Special Topic include: \u2022 how languages shape the cognitive representations of gender \u2022 how features of languages correspond with gender equality in different societies \u2022 how language contributes to social behaviour towards the sexes \u2022 how gender equality can be promoted through strategies for gender-fair language use These questions are explored both developmentally (across the life span from childhood to old age) and in adults. The contributions present work conducted across a wide range of languages, including some studies that make cross-linguistic comparisons. Among the contributors are both cognitive and social psychologists and linguists, all with an excellent research standing. The studies employ a wide range of empirical methods: from surveys to electro-physiology. The papers in the Special Topic present a wide range of complimentary studies, which will make a substantial contribution to understanding in this important area.",

        "description": "This book brings together results from the Web search studies we conducted from 1997 through 2004. The aim of our studies has been twofold: to examine how the public at large searches the Web and to highlight trends in public Web searching. The eight-year period from 1997 to 2004 saw the beginnings and maturity of public Web searching. Commercial Web search engines have come and gone, or endured, through the fall of the dot.com companies. We saw the rise and, in some cases, the demise of several high profile, publicly available Web search engines. The study of the Web search is an exciting and important area of interdisciplinary research. Our book provides a valuable insight into the growth and development of human interaction with Web search engines. In this book, our focus is on the human aspect of the interaction between user and Web search engine. We do not investigate the Web search engines themselves or their constantly changing interfaces, algorithms and features. We focus on exploring the cognitive and user aspects of public Web searching in the aggregate. We use a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods within the overall methodology known as transaction log analysis.",

        "description": "The International Handbook of Research in Professional and Practice-based Learning discusses what constitutes professionalism, examines the concepts and practices of professional and practice-based learning, including associated research traditions and educational provisions. It also explores professional learning in institutions of higher and vocational education as well the practice settings where professionals work and learn, focusing on both initial and ongoing development and how that learning is assessed. The Handbook features research from expert contributors in education, studies of the professions, and accounts of research methodologies from a range of informing disciplines. It is organized in two parts. The first part sets out conceptions of professionalism at work, how professions, work and learning can be understood, and examines the kinds of institutional practices organized for developing occupational capacities. The second part focuses on procedural issues associated with learning for and through professional practice, and how assessment of professional capacities might progress. The key premise of this Handbook is that during both initial and ongoing professional development, individual learning processes are influenced and shaped through their professional environment and practices. Moreover, in turn, the practice and processes of learning through practice are shaped by their development, all of which are required to be understood through a range of research orientations, methods and findings. This Handbook will appeal to academics working in fields of professional practice, including those who are concerned about developing these capacities in their students. In addition, students and research students will also find this Handbook a key reference resource to the field.",

Conducting effective scholarly research can seem like a frustrating, confusing, and unpleasant experience. Early researchers often have inconsistent knowledge and experience, and can become overwhelmed \u2013 reducing their ability to produce high quality work. Rather than a book about research, this is a practical guide to doing research. It guides budding researchers along the process of developing an effective workflow, where to go for help, and how to actually complete the project. The book addresses diversity in abilities, interest, discipline, and ways of knowing by focusing not just on the process of conducting any one method in detail, but also on the ways in which someone might choose a research method and conduct it successfully. Finally, it emphasizes accessibility and approachability through real-world examples, key insights, tips, and tricks from active researchers. This book is a highly useful addition to both content area courses and research methods courses, as well as a practical guide for graduate students and independent scholars interested in publishing their research.",

Women constitute a special risk category for NMUPD and understanding gender as it relates to this phenomenon is now a critical requirement for effective policy and practice. Intended primarily for policy makers and researchers, this Pompidou Group publication aims to explore gender specificities in terms of the use and misuse of prescription drugs in Europe and the Mediterranean region. Using secondary sources, it also seeks to identify gaps in the data available in the area covered and to make recommendations for further research, coherent policy development and effective, gender-sensitive practice. This publication is an initial attempt to map this emerging phenomenon and to identify lacunae and avenues for further investigation.

        "description": "Over one billion people use the Internet globally. Psychologists are beginning to understand what people do online, and the impact being online has on behaviour. It's making us re-think many of our existing assumptions about what it means to be a social being. For instance, if we can talk, flirt, meet people and fall in love online, this challenges many of psychology's theories that intimacy or understanding requires physical co-presence. \"The Oxford Handbook of Internet Psychology\" brings together many of the leading researchers in what can be termed 'Internet Psychology'. Though a very new area of research, it is growing at a phenomenal pace. In addition to well-studied areas of investigation, such as social identity theory, computer-mediated communication and virtual communities, the volume also includes chapters on topics as diverse as deception and misrepresentation, attitude change and persuasion online, Internet addiction, online relationships, privacy and trust, health and leisure use of the Internet, and the nature of interactivity. With over 30 chapters written by experts in the field, the range and depth of coverage is unequalled, and serves to define this emerging area of research. Uniquely, this content is supported by an entire section covering the use of the Internet as a research tool, including qualitative and quantitative methods, online survey design, personality testing, ethics, and technological and design issues. While it is likely to be a popular research resource to be 'dipped into', as a whole volume it is coherent and compelling enough to act as a single text book. \"The Oxford Handbook of Internet Psychology\" is the definitive text on this burgeoning field. It will be an essential resource for anyone interested in the psychological aspects of Internet use, or planning to conduct research using the 'net'.",

        "description": "In this essential guide to understanding how branding is evolving, learn how companies affect behavior via marketing communications, distribution strategies, and customer service. Most people don't know it yet, but branding is dead. Sure, we need to know about the stuff we want to buy, but the billions of dollars spent on logos, sponsorships, and jingles have little, if anything, to do with actual consumer behavior. For example: Dinosaur-headed execs in Microsoft ads didn't help sell software. Citibank's artsy \"live richly\" billboards didn't prompt a single new account. United Airlines' animated TV commercials didn't fill more seats on airplanes. As branding guru Jonathan Baskin reveals, modern consumers are harder to find, more difficult to convince, and near-impossible to retain. They make decisions based on experience\u2014so what matters isn't how creative, cool, or memorable the advertising is, but how companies can directly target consumer behavior. Pretty pictures and funny taglines should be an afterthought: brands must target what consumers actually do.",

As the Web continues to grow and new technologies, modes of interaction, and applications are being developed, the task of the Semantic Web is to unlock the power of information available on the Web into a common semantic inf- mation space and to make it available for sharing and processing by automated tools as well as by people. Right now, the publication of large datasets on the Web, the opening of data access interfaces, and the encoding of the semantics of the data extend the current human-centric Web. Now, the Semantic Web c- munity is tackling the challenges of how to create and manage Semantic Web content, how to make Semantic Web applications robust and scalable, and how to organize and integrate information from di?erent sources for novel uses. To foster the exchange of ideas and collaboration, the International Semantic Web Conference brings together researchers and practitioners in relevant disciplines such as arti?cial intelligence, databases, social networks, distributed computing, Web engineering, information systems, natural language processing, soft c- puting, and human\u2013computer interaction. This volume contains the main proceedings of ISWC 2008, which we are - cited to o?er to the growing community of researchers and practitioners of the Semantic Web. We got a tremendous response to our call for research papers from a truly international community of researchers and practitioners from 41 countries submitting 261 papers.

But here\u2019s the exciting part: problem-based learning doesn\u2019t require weeks of study or an end-of-year project. In this book, Brian Pete and Robin Fogarty show how you can use problem-based learning as a daily approach to helping students learn authentic and relevant content and skills. They explain how to engage students in each of the seven steps in the problem-based learning model, so students learn how to develop good questions, launch their inquiry, gather information, organize their information, create evidence, present their findings, and assess their learning. Using practical examples, they also describe how to help students master these seven important thinking skills: develop, analyze, reason, understand, solve, apply, and evaluate. To put all this in context, the authors offer seven \u201cPBL in a Nutshell\u201d lessons that can easily be incorporated in a single classroom period. Depth of thinking and ease of implementation--this is problem-based learning at its best.",

Big data can be used to tally clicks and traffic on web pages, find patterns in stock trades, track consumer preferences, identify linguistic correlations in large corpuses of texts. This book examines big data not as an undifferentiated whole but contextually, investigating the varied challenges posed by big data for health, science, law, commerce, and politics. Taken together, the chapters reveal a complex set of problems, practices, and policies. The advent of big data methodologies has challenged the theory-driven approach to scientific knowledge in favor of a data-driven one. Social media platforms and self-tracking tools change the way we see ourselves and others. The collection of data by corporations and government threatens privacy while promoting transparency. Meanwhile, politicians, policy makers, and ethicists are ill-prepared to deal with big data's ramifications. The contributors look at big data's effect on individuals as it exerts social control through monitoring, mining, and manipulation; big data and society, examining both its empowering and its constraining effects; big data and science, considering issues of data governance, provenance, reuse, and trust; and big data and organizations, discussing data responsibility, \u201cdata harm,\u201d and decision making.

        "description": "Passion is a pervasive concept in the work domain. Workers aspire to be passionate in the hope of finding meaning and satisfaction from their professional life, while employers dream of passionate employees who will ensure organizational performance. Does passion for work matter ? Does passion invariably bring about the anticipated positive outcomes or is there a darker side to passion for work that can also lead to negative outcomes for individuals and organizations? The goal of this book is to address these issues. This volume reviews major theories of work passion, focusing specifically on the dominant theory: the Dualistic Model of Passion. This theory distinguishes between two types of passion-harmonious and obsessive- and their associated determinants and consequences. This volume provides a comprehensive understanding of passion for work by addressing the origin of the concept and its theoretical issues: how can passion for work be developed, what are the consequences to be expected at the individual and organizational levels, and how can passion for work shed new light on contemporary issues in the workplace. Passion for Work: Theory, Research, and Applications synthesizes a vast body of existing research in the area, provides insights into new and exciting research avenues, and explores how passion for work can be cultivated in work settings in order to fulfill both workers' and employers' hopes for a productive and satisfying work life.",

It offers clinical and administrative guidelines for innovative and effective programs addressing critical problems among rural youth and in areas where funding and resources are scarce. Chapters cover program development, implementation, sustainability, and evaluation; consider issues of community and policy support; address barriers to access and delivery; and debunk misconceptions about the region and its cultures. Chapters also discuss rural SMH applications relating to special populations, including students with autism, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, conduct disorders, and ADHD. In addition, the book examines the potential of school-based programs as a counter to the stigma and distrust of mental health services common to the region. \u201c/div>Topics featured in the Handbook include: The value of rural SMH from an educator\u2019s standpoint. Preventing suicide among students in rural schools. Substance abuse in rural school settings. Bullying and cyberbully among rural youth. Intergenerational patterns of mental illness in rural settings and their relevance for SMH. The importance of involving communities in culturally competent rural interventions. The Handbook of Rural School Mental Health is a must-have resource for researchers, scientist-practitioners, and graduate students in child and school psychology, educational psychology, social work/counseling, educational policymakers, pediatrics/school nursing, teaching, and teacher education.div",

However, current scholarly attempts to demonstrate that the period encompasses a rich and varied range of poets, essayists, and novelists of both genders have caused the definition to come under debate. Not limiting itself to these six figures, Literary Research and the British Romantic Era discusses English, Scottish, Irish, and Welsh resources for both primary and secondary research within the Romantic Era, including general literary research guides; union library catalogs; print and online bibliographies; manuscripts and archives; microfilm and digitization projects; eighteenth and nineteenth century journals and newspapers; contemporary reviews; and electronic texts, journals, and Web resources. Each chapter addresses the best methods to extract relevant information from the research tools employed, enabling scholars to find relevant materials. The strengths and weakness of core and specialized electronic and print research tools and standard search techniques are also examined.",

This book, edited by Ashok Srivastava, Ramakrishna Nemani, and Karsten Steinhaeuser, serves as an outstanding resource for anyone interested in the opportunities and challenges for the machine learning community in analyzing these data sets to answer questions of urgent societal interest...I hope that this book will inspire more computer scientists to focus on environmental applications, and Earth scientists to seek collaborations with researchers in machine learning and data mining to advance the frontiers in Earth sciences.\" --Vipin Kumar, University of Minnesota Large-Scale Machine Learning in the Earth Sciences provides researchers and practitioners with a broad overview of some of the key challenges in the intersection of Earth science, computer science, statistics, and related fields. It explores a wide range of topics and provides a compilation of recent research in the application of machine learning in the field of Earth Science. Making predictions based on observational data is a theme of the book, and the book includes chapters on the use of network science to understand and discover teleconnections in extreme climate and weather events, as well as using structured estimation in high dimensions. The use of ensemble machine learning models to combine predictions of global climate models using information from spatial and temporal patterns is also explored. The second part of the book features a discussion on statistical downscaling in climate with state-of-the-art scalable machine learning, as well as an overview of methods to understand and predict the proliferation of biological species due to changes in environmental conditions. The problem of using large-scale machine learning to study the formation of tornadoes is also explored in depth. The last part of the book covers the use of deep learning algorithms to classify images that have very high resolution, as well as the unmixing of spectral signals in remote sensing images of land cover. The authors also apply long-tail distributions to geoscience resources, in the final chapter of the book.",

        "description": "In Philip K. Dick\u2019s short story Minority Report, the institution of Precrime punishes people with imprisonment for crimes they would have committed had they not been prevented. With Dick\u2019s allegorical inspiration, the authors of Criminal Law and Precrime: Legal Studies in Canadian Punishment and Surveillance in Anticipation of Criminal Guilt posit that recent developments in Canadian law indicate a trend toward imposing punitive measures at increasingly earlier stages of the prosecutorial process. The result is a potentially new field of criminal management that could be characterized as \"precrime\"\u2014particularly the use of the law as a technology of surveillance and prevention since \"terror\" became a justification for intervention. The authors note that as risk management logics (based in actuarial sciences) have shifted to precautionary ones (based in administrative sciences), the law has responded by developing techniques in the arena of criminal regulation in light of the \"war on terror\": the need to ensure security, the proliferation of digital data, and the development of drones, social networking, and cloud storage to gather personal data. The authors view shifts in criminal investigation; the substantive criminal law of sexual expression, conduct, and work; and civil forfeiture as emblematic of precrime populism. The unifying theme of these techniques is that they occur prior to state-identified crime, arise out of a precautionary philosophy, and seek to presume (or circumvent) criminality. The book is a provocative read for scholars and students in criminal law, policing, and surveillance, as well as for those interested in how areas of law, such as immigration, health, and anti-terrorism, are mobilizing the logics of risk and surveillance in new ways that emphasize precaution. The authors invite legal scholars to place the analytical lens of precrime on criminal and regulatory practices in Canada as well as other Western nations across the globe.",

It presents a collection of approaches to teaching bibliographic skills to history students at three levels: undergraduates, advanced undergraduates, and graduate students. Each topic is covered by an expert. The work opens with two chapters discussing (1) Historical Methodologies and Research and (2) History and Interdisciplinary History. Attention is then directed to bibliographic instruction in history, with chapters on finding and using historical materials and bibliographic instruction in history. Other chapters consider special topics--including catalogs and indexes, reference sources, sources for interdisciplinary research, electronic information sources, and using the finding aids to archive and manuscript collections. The work concludes with an extensive and wide ranging annotated bibliography of books, articles, and other literature. Thoughtful and convenient, this book is a rich source of instructional insights, ideas, and designs. In its totality, it presents bibliographic and library research skills as an integral part of the historical enterprise.",

        "description": "The information world has undergone drastic changes since the publication of the 3rd edition of The Oxford Guide to Library Research in 2005, and Thomas Mann, a veteran reference librarian at the Library of Congress, has extensively revised his text to reflect those changes. This book will answer two basic questions: First, what is the extent of the significant research resources you will you miss if you confine your research entirely, or even primarily, to sources available on the open Internet? Second, if you are trying to get a reasonably good overview of the literature on a particular topic, rather than just \"something quickly\" on it, what are the several alternative methods of subject searching--which are not available on the Web--that are usually much more efficient for that purpose than typing keywords into a blank search box, with the results displayed by relevance-ranking computer algorithms? This book shows researchers how to do comprehensive research on any topic. It explains the variety of search mechanisms available, so that the researcher can have the reasonable confidence that s/he has not overlooked something important. This includes not just lists of resources, but discussions of the ways to search within them: how to find the best search terms, how to combine the terms, and how to make the databases (and other sources) show relevant material even when you don't know how to specify the best search terms in advance. The book's overall structuring by nine methods of searching that are applicable in any subject area, rather than by subjects or by types of literature, is unique among guides to research. Also unique is the range and variety of concrete examples of what to do--and of what not to do. The book is not \"about\" the Internet: it is about the best alternatives to the Internet--the sources that are not on the open Web to begin with, that can be found only through research libraries and that are more than ever necessary for any kind of substantive scholarly research. More than any other research guide available, this book directly addresses and provides solutions to the serious problems outlined in recent studies documenting the profound lack of research skills possessed by today's \"digital natives.\"",

Building on the authors\u2019 extensive academic and practical knowledge, this book aims to provide managers and analysts with strategic directions and practical analytical solutions on how to create value from existing and new big data.

An entire generation of young people that is now beginning to influence mass culture and politics came of age on Tumblr, and this volume is an indispensable guide to the many ways this platform works.",

It has been written by a professional search engine consultant. Richard Conway started his company, Pure SEO, in 2009 with just $200 to spend on a single web page. From there, mostly using digital marketing, he has expanded the business to four offices in New Zealand and Australia. Pure SEO has been listed by Deloitte in the fastest-growing 500 tech companies in the Asia Pacific region for the past five years. This practical guide cuts through the mis-information and sets the record straight on what actions you need to take, so searchers will find your product quickly and easily. It covers keywords, website content and structure, mobile search and optimisation, loading speed of your website and how that affects searches, planning content to make it easily searchable, tracking tools and much much more. With Australasian-focused statistics and insights, as well as advice about how these two markets differ, the book is an authoritative and accessible 'how to' resource. Case studies and Q&A sections provide real-life dos and don'ts. As well as actionable advice and 'red flags' to avoid, the book also looks ahead to consider the future of search marketing.",

        "description": "Databases and public access catalogs are being used extensively by the public and the academic and business communities as major sources of information. Most users want to access these databases directly to locate the information they need. Increasingly, users are demanding user-friendly databases that will assist them in finding conceptual information effectively. The lack of compatibility or standardization among many different indexing vocabularies and thesauri makes it difficult to find related information in information retrieval systems containing many different online databases. This book provides a thought-provoking new perspective on the role of vocabulary control in providing access to the conceptual information found in online databases and catalogs. The first three chapters provide a basis for understanding the structure of vocabulary control systems used for the indexing of conceptual information. Chapters 4 and 5, which deal with thesaural relationship model formulation and investigation, will be of the greatest interest to designers of online databases and public access catalogs who are striving to improve access to conceptual information from multiple databases. Researchers and developers of thesauri, who are faced with the problems of compatibility and convertibility, will also be interested in testing the applicability of the thesaural relationship model for other vocabulary control systems. The findings reported in chapter six will be of particular interest to database producers and vendors. Although switching and frequency online search strategies for database search engines are not yet available, end-users and experienced searchers can still incorporate these concepts to improve the effectiveness of their searches. Recommendations resulting from this investigation are summarized in the final chapters. With the proliferation of online databases and the increasing number of inexperienced users, the development of new search strategies to facilitate easier searches is critical. This book will be required reading for everyone involved in this effort.",

        "description": "About Google Ads, Google is the most used search engine by users around the world. As of now, more than 92%of the online users are using Google to find information about the products, services and to learn more about the new things. Only the remaining 8% of the online usage is shared by the other search engines like Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, Yandex, and DuckDuckGo. From this insights, it is clear that if you would like to get more reach for your business online, then Google Search is one of the medium by using which you can get in touch with the right audience for your business. By using the Google search, you can get in touch with the right audience for your business in two ways, one is via OrganicSEO & the other one is GooglePPC. Organic SEO is the way of optimizing the business website to rank for the potential search terms. When it comes to SEO, you need to invest a lot of time & effort to make the business website rank for potential search terms. The second one is the Google PPC, Google has its own advertising platform called Google AdWords (Ads)/ Google PPC (Pay Per Click), By using the GoogleAds, you can make the target users land on your website from the Google search by making your business ads to rank above the organic search results. When it comes to Google Ads, you need to pay for Google when any of the users from the Google Search clicks on your ads and lands on your website. BothSEO & Google PPC has its own pros and cons. The main advantage of the SEO is that you don\u2019t need to pay for Google for the users landing on your website from the search. But you need to invest more on SEO to rank the website on top of the SERP\u2019s (Search Engine Results Page) for the potential search terms. When it comes to Google PPC, you need to pay to Google for each and every click that you receive on your ads on Google Search from the normal users. Despite both the SEO & Google PPC, as a business people, you should be giving equal importance to both to stand ahead of your competitors.",

Sure, you know how to \"Google it\" when you're searching for something--anything!--on the Web. It's plenty fast and easy to use. But did you know how much more you could achieve with the world's best search engine by clicking beyond the \"Google Search\" button? While you can interface with Google in 97 languages and glean results in 35, you can't find any kind of instruction manual from Google. Lucky for you, our fully updated and greatly expanded second edition to the bestselling Google: The Missing Manual covers everything you could possibly want to know about Google, including the newest and coolest--and often most underused (what is Froogle, anyway?)--features. There's even a full chapter devoted to Gmail, Google's free email service that includes a whopping 2.5 GB of space). This wise and witty guide delivers the complete scoop on Google, from how it works to how you can search far more effectively and efficiently (no more scrolling through 168 pages of seemingly irrelevant results); take best advantage of Google's lesser-known features, such as Google Print, Google Desktop, and Google Suggest; get your website listed on Google; track your visitors with Google Analytics; make money with AdWords and AdSense; and much more. Whether you're new to Google or already a many-times-a-day user, you're sure to find tutorials, tips, tricks, and tools that take you well beyond simple search to Google gurudom.",

It's so simple that this book is fewer than 50 pages long! You won't get bogged down with boring, technical descriptions and geek-speak; this book is written in easy-to-read plain English, with plenty of examples and clear descriptions of technical terms where they are absolutely necessary. \"But I'm not a web designer!\" You don't need to be. You just need to be able to create simple web pages. \"I don't have a budget for paid ads!\" This book is not about paying for \"sponsored links,\" adwords, or any other kind of paid advertising. The technique we describe will cost you nothing other than the price of this book and some of your time.",

        "description": "Chapter 1 places into perspective a total Information Storage and Retrieval System. This perspective introduces new challenges to the problems that need to be theoretically addressed and commercially implemented. Ten years ago commercial implementation of the algorithms being developed was not realistic, allowing theoreticians to limit their focus to very specific areas. Bounding a problem is still essential in deriving theoretical results. But the commercialization and insertion of this technology into systems like the Internet that are widely being used changes the way problems are bounded. From a theoretical perspective, efficient scalability of algorithms to systems with gigabytes and terabytes of data, operating with minimal user search statement information, and making maximum use of all functional aspects of an information system need to be considered. The dissemination systems using persistent indexes or mail files to modify ranking algorithms and combining the search of structured information fields and free text into a consolidated weighted output are examples of potential new areas of investigation. The best way for the theoretician or the commercial developer to understand the importance of problems to be solved is to place them in the context of a total vision of a complete system. Understanding the differences between Digital Libraries and Information Retrieval Systems will add an additional dimension to the potential future development of systems. The collaborative aspects of digital libraries can be viewed as a new source of information that dynamically could interact with information retrieval techniques.",

        "description": "Google, the most popular search engine worldwide, provides web surfers with an easy-to-use guide to the Internet, with web and image searches, language translation, and a range of features that make web navigation simple enough for even the novice user. What many users don\u2019t realize is that the deceptively simple components that make Google so easy to use are the same features that generously unlock security flaws for the malicious hacker. Vulnerabilities in website security can be discovered through Google hacking, techniques applied to the search engine by computer criminals, identity thieves, and even terrorists to uncover secure information. This book beats Google hackers to the punch, equipping web administrators with penetration testing applications to ensure their site is invulnerable to a hacker\u2019s search. Penetration Testing with Google Hacks explores the explosive growth of a technique known as \"Google Hacking.\" When the modern security landscape includes such heady topics as \"blind SQL injection\" and \"integer overflows,\" it's refreshing to see such a deceptively simple tool bent to achieve such amazing results; this is hacking in the purest sense of the word. Readers will learn how to torque Google to detect SQL injection points and login portals, execute port scans and CGI scans, fingerprint web servers, locate incredible information caches such as firewall and IDS logs, password databases, SQL dumps and much more - all without sending a single packet to the target! Borrowing the techniques pioneered by malicious \"Google hackers,\" this talk aims to show security practitioners how to properly protect clients from this often overlooked and dangerous form of information leakage. *First book about Google targeting IT professionals and security leaks through web browsing. *Author Johnny Long, the authority on Google hacking, will be speaking about \"Google Hacking\" at the Black Hat 2004 Briefing. His presentation on penetrating security flaws with Google is expected to create a lot of buzz and exposure for the topic. *Johnny Long's Web site hosts the largest repository of Google security exposures and is the most popular destination for security professionals who want to learn about the dark side of Google.",

The Internet has over 350 million pages of data and is expected to reach over one billion pages by the year 2000. Buried on the Internet are both valuable nuggets to answer questions as well as a large quantity of information the average person does not care about. The Digital Library effort is also progressing, with the goal of migrating from the traditional book environment to a digital library environment. The challenge to both authors of new publications that will reside on this information domain and developers of systems to locate information is to provide the information and capabilities to sort out the non-relevant items from those desired by the consumer. In effect, as we proceed down this path, it will be the computer that determines what we see versus the human being. The days of going to a library and browsing the new book shelf are being replaced by electronic searching the Internet or the library catalogs. Whatever the search engines return will constrain our knowledge of what information is available. An understanding of Information Retrieval Systems puts this new environment into perspective for both the creator of documents and the consumer trying to locate information.",

        "description": "The technological advancements in computer networks have caused a explosion of digitally stored information. In particular, textual information is becoming increasingly available in electronic form. Finding text documents dealing with a certain topic is not a simple task. Users need tools to sift through non-relevant information and retrieve only pieces of information relevant to their needs. The traditional methods of information retrieval based on term frequency have somehow reached their limitations. The retrieval of documents based on the positions of search terms in a document has the potential of yielding improvements, because other terms in the environment where a search term appears are considered. However, the required additional analysis task makes position based methods slower than traditional methods, affecting the performance of the most user critical phase of the retrieval process. This thesis explores the possibility of extending traditional information retrieval systems with positional information in an efficient manner optimizing the retrieval performance by handling term positions at query evaluation time.",

The report begins with an illustrated overview of retrieval features and subject searching in current second-generation OPACs, which is followed by a discussion of the problems and shortcomings of conventional OPACs and online information retrieval systems, especially with regard to subject access and retrieval methods. A summary discussion of perspectives, models, and design contributions from the information retrieval research and experimentation community is then presented, and an illustrated review and analysis of intelligent interfaces and retrieval methods is provided. The discussion facilitates a refined grouping of the issues into four major areas: (1) ease of use, orientation, and presentation factors; (2) vocabulary control and correlation factors; (3) more effective system-guided or automatic query formulation and retrieval techniques; and (4) meaningful engagement of the searcher in relevance assessments, query modification/expansion, and provision of smart navigational, exploration facilities. A summary of recommended design principles and achievements in intelligent interface and retrieval system design concludes the report. A checklist of features of second-generation OPACs and a list of OPAC and retrieval systems and software investigated for the study are appended. (51 references) (MES)",

In particular, reverse image search is characterized by a lack of search terms. This effectively removes the need for a user to guess at keywords or terms that may or may not return a correct result. Reverse image search also allows users to discover content that is related to a specific sample image or the popularity of an image, and to discover manipulated versions and derivative works. How you will benefit (I) Insights, and validations about the following topics: Chapter 1: Reverse image search Chapter 2: Web crawler Chapter 3: Image retrieval Chapter 4: Recommender system Chapter 5: Document retrieval Chapter 6: Content-based image retrieval Chapter 7: Automatic image annotation Chapter 8: Inverted index Chapter 9: Google Images Chapter 10: Social search (II) Answering the public top questions about reverse image search.

        "description": "Evolving pieces of evidence show that services are hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, both globally and in Egypt. Employing Google search data, we examine the implications of COVID-19 on demand for various services in Egypt. \u2022 We find that demand for those services that require face-to-face interaction, including hotels and restaurants, air travel and tourism services, significantly dipped after Egypt detected the first COVID-19 case and more so after the Egyptian government introduced major restrictions and curfews. For instance, in the first two months of the outbreak of the pandemic, February and March, demand for hotel and restaurant services contracted by about 70 percent. \u2022 In contrast, demand for services that substitute or reduce personal interactions, such as information and communications technologies (ICT) and delivery services, have enjoyed a significant boost. Demand for ICT services tripled, while demand for delivery services doubled in the four months since the outbreak of the pandemic. \u2022 Intuitively, these results suggest that individuals and enterprises operating in these sectors are expected to experience heterogenous impacts and damages associated with the pandemic. Our results, along with other evolving evidence, reinforce that those services and sectors negatively affected by the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 deserve attention. \u2022 Finally, our analysis highlights the potential of near real-time \"big data\" to substitute and complement conventional data sources to estimate economic impacts and, hence, inform immediate and medium-term policy responses.",

In order to appreciate these philosophical beliefs, several key concepts and terms require consideration and understanding. Complicating the novice researcher\u2019s understanding of these ideas is the unfortunate reality that existing definitions can be confusing. This situation can leave students feeling overwhelmed and confused. The purpose of this book is to provide an overview of major inquiry or research paradigms in a simplified way. The terms discussed in this book include, but are not limited to: Paradigm Axiology Ontology Epistemology Methodology Paradigm shift Positivism Modernism Post-modernism Post-positivism Critical Theory Constructivism Keep in mind that the terms covered in this book are often debated, understood, and communicated in multiple \u201ccorrect\u201d ways. Also, due to the evolving nature of knowledge and diverse perspectives within the literature, this book serves as an introduction to research terminology that will help you understand, follow, and even participate in this debate. This book will be particularly useful to nursing students who are learning about nursing inquiry. Nursing is a field in which inquiry skills are integral to the development of best evidence and furthering of the profession as a whole.",

This student friendly manual will help students adhere to the basics of American Psychological Association (APA) style; refine critical thinking skills, library search skills, revising skills, editing skills, and proofing skills; and avoid plagiarism. This text is an adaptation of an earlier text published by Robert O'Shea. Checklists for students, which have been praised by reviewers, precede the summary at the end of every chapter, giving students the chance to make sure they have been thorough in their reports.",
